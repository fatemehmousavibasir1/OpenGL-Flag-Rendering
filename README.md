# OpenGL-Flag-Rendering

This project uses OpenGL with GLUT to render two national flags:  
🇺🇸 **United States of America** and 🇿🇦 **South Africa**.

##  Overview

The program utilizes basic OpenGL 2D primitives to draw:

- The red and white stripes, blue field, and stars of the **USA flag**.
- The colorful geometric shapes of the **South African flag**.

Each flag is rendered in its own function (`USA()` and `South_Africa()`), which can be linked to the `display` callback or used in a menu for selection.

## 🖥 Requirements

- OpenGL
- GLUT 
- C++ compiler
